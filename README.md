> 3. In the mystical land of Pythoria, during each full moon, a magical ritual takes place where two enchanted scrolls containing powerful spells must be swapped and encrypted for safekeeping. ( 8 Marks )
## Task
~~~
Develop a spell (program) to automate the swapping and encryption of the two ancient scrolls owned by Elara and Orion.
The encryption mechanism is a variation of the Caesar cipher, with a unique twist for dual encryption.
~~~
## Challenge
### Magic Chest Mechanism:
1. The chest has two compartments for Elara's and Orion's scrolls.
2. Upon insertion, the chest swaps the scrolls and applies the secret encryption.
3. Implement a program that mimics this magical chest’s functionality.
### Encryption Details:
1. The encryption is a Caesar cipher where each letter in the scroll is shifted by a certain number down the alphabet.
2. The shift value changes with each full moon, based on the lunar phase.
### The twist: 
1. When one scroll is encrypted with a shift (e.g., +3), the other scroll must be encrypted in reverse (e.g., -3).
### Program Requirements:
1. Accept two strings, representing the scrolls' contents.
2. Swap these strings to simulate the chest’s magic.
3. Encrypt each scroll using the Caesar cipher, applying opposite shifts to each scroll.
4. Output the encrypted contents of both scrolls after the swap.
### Concepts to Utilize
1. Variables: To hold the contents of each scroll and the shift value.
2. String Manipulation: To perform the Caesar cipher encryption.
3. Tuple Assignment: To efficiently swap the scrolls' contents.
4. Basic Encryption Logic: Implementing the Caesar cipher with a twist for dual encryption.
